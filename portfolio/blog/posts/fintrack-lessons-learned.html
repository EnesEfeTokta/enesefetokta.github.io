                    <p>
                        Hi, I'm Enes Efe Tokta.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In this article, I don't want to document FinTrack as a technical manual. Instead, I want to
                        share the <strong>decisions I made</strong>, the <strong>challenges I faced</strong>, and the
                        <strong>engineering mindset I developed</strong> while building this project.
                    </p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> This is Not a Step-by-Step Guide</h4>
                        <p>
                            You can find the technical implementation details in the
                            <a href="https://github.com/EnesEfeTokta" target="_blank"
                                style="color: var(--accent-primary);">GitHub repository</a>.
                            The purpose of this article is to explain how my way of thinking evolved while designing
                            and building a backend system from scratch.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>From Game Development to Web Backend</h2>

                    <p>
                        For nearly four years, I primarily worked with Unity and game development. During that time,
                        my first interaction with a backend API sending requests from Unity unexpectedly sparked my
                        interest in the web side of software development.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Because I already had a strong C# background, transitioning to ASP.NET Core felt natural.
                        However, my first experience with it was far from smooth. I struggled not because the framework
                        was complex, but because <strong>I hadn't yet understood the philosophy behind the .NET
                            ecosystem</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once I started learning how .NET approaches architecture, responsibility separation, and
                        long-term maintainability, ASP.NET Core began to make sense. At that point, I realized something
                        important:
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "The way I think about problems aligns well with backend development."
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        That realization led me to focus fully on web backend engineering.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Why a Financial System?</h2>

                    <p>
                        The idea for FinTrack didn't come out of nowhere. While researching how to improve as a .NET
                        developer, I came across a recommendation on Reddit:
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "If you really want to become good at .NET, build a financial system."
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        That advice resonated with me. Financial systems:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Contain <strong>complex business rules</strong></li>
                        <li>Strongly enforce <strong>object-oriented design principles</strong></li>
                        <li>Require <strong>data integrity, security, and consistency</strong></li>
                        <li>Closely resemble <strong>real-world enterprise software</strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        In other words, they are excellent learning tools not just technically, but from a software
                        engineering perspective. That's why I decided to build FinTrack as a financial tracking system.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Architectural Uncertainty and Planning</h2>

                    <p>
                        Before writing any code, my biggest challenge was <strong>choosing the right
                            architecture</strong>.
                        Since ASP.NET Core is commonly used with MVC, I decided to adopt it and learn it properly rather
                        than cutting corners.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, I quickly realized that a financial system isn't just about writing controllers and
                        models—it requires careful planning.
                    </p>

                    <div class="decision-box">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i> The Planning Phase</h4>
                        <p>I stepped away from the keyboard and started working with pen and paper:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Designing classes</li>
                            <li>Defining relationships</li>
                            <li>Mapping business flows</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Because I planned to use PostgreSQL, I also needed a solid database schema early on.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Throughout this process, I repeatedly asked myself:
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "If I were the user, what would I expect from this system?"
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        For example, separating the concepts of <code>Account</code> and <code>Budget</code> took days
                        of thought. At first, they felt interchangeable. Today, that distinction feels obvious but only
                        because I wrestled with it early in the design phase.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Infrastructure Reality: Learning Docker</h2>

                    <p>
                        At this stage, I decided to introduce Docker into the project. I containerized both the web
                        application and the database.
                    </p>

                    <div class="lesson-box">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> Lesson Learned</h4>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Software is not just code it's a lifecycle.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            How an application starts, runs, scales, and is maintained is part of development. Once I
                            understood Docker's purpose and mental model, the rest of the infrastructure decisions
                            became
                            much clearer.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Data Layer Decisions: Choosing EF Core</h2>

                    <p>
                        Initially, I handled database operations using raw SQL queries. Later, I explored ORMs and
                        narrowed my options to:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Dapper</strong> - Performance and simplicity</li>
                        <li><strong>Entity Framework Core</strong> - LINQ integration, migrations, database abstraction
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="decision-box">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> Engineering Decision</h4>
                        <p>
                            Since FinTrack was not targeting massive scale, I accepted EF Core's performance trade-offs
                            in exchange for development speed and maintainability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>This was a deliberate engineering decision not a default choice.</strong>
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>AI Integration: Idealism Meets Reality</h2>

                    <p>
                        As AI-driven features became increasingly popular, I wanted to integrate an AI-powered analysis
                        component into FinTrack.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I initially experimented with Semantic Kernel, but its tight coupling with OpenAI made
                        integration with Google Gemini difficult. After nearly five days of experimentation, I reached
                        an important conclusion:
                    </p>

                    <div class="lesson-box">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Critical Realization</h4>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Forcing a technology into a project rarely leads to good design.</strong>
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Instead of pushing further, I restructured the system. I designed a separate Python-based
                        FastAPI service responsible for AI interactions.
                    </p>

                    <p>The flow became:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>ASP.NET Core → FastAPI</li>
                        <li>FastAPI → LLM</li>
                        <li>Response → ASP.NET Core</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        Due to API limits and cost considerations, I later switched to a local LLM setup using Docker
                        with Ollama and Mistral 7B. This experience taught me the importance of <strong>dependency
                            control
                            and architectural flexibility</strong>.

                    <h2>Discovering SaaS and Payment Systems</h2>

                    <p>
                        While developing FinTrack, I encountered the concept of <strong>SaaS (Software as a
                            Service)</strong>.
                        Initially, I thought SaaS simply meant subscriptions. Over time, I realized it represents a
                        product-oriented mindset, not just a billing model.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Motivated by this insight, I implemented a membership and subscription system.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Because global payment solutions like PayPal are not fully available in Turkey, and local POS
                        providers impose strict data constraints, I chose <strong>Stripe</strong> for integration. My
                        goal
                        was not monetization it was hands-on experience with a real-world payment infrastructure.
                    </p>

                    <p>During this process, I implemented:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Plan-based subscriptions</li>
                        <li>Authorization tiers</li>
                        <li>Stripe webhook handling</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Since Stripe requires a public domain, I used <code>ngrok</code> instead of purchasing a domain,
                        exposing my local environment temporarily. This decision was purely learning-driven.
                    </p>

                    <h2>A Conceptual Experiment: Secure Debt System</h2>

                    <p>
                        To differentiate FinTrack conceptually, I designed a <strong>Secure Debt System</strong> as a
                        thought experiment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This system included debt offers, approvals, video confirmation, encryption, and one-time access
                        keys. Legal considerations were intentionally excluded it was designed purely as a system design
                        exercise.
                    </p>

                    <div class="lesson-box">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Security Learning</h4>
                        <p>
                            This feature significantly improved my understanding of <strong>encryption</strong>,
                            <strong>access control</strong>, and <strong>data security</strong>.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Operational Experience</h2>

                    <p>
                        Beyond core functionality, I also experimented with:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>CI/CD</strong> using GitHub Actions</li>
                        <li><strong>Secret scanning</strong> and security best practices</li>
                        <li><strong>Monitoring</strong> with Prometheus and Grafana</li>
                        <li><strong>Automated database backups</strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        None of these were strictly required—but they helped me build a system that resembles
                        <strong>real-world production environments</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-star"></i> Project Summary</h4>
                        <p>
                            FinTrack was the result of roughly <strong>five months of focused development</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It didn't just teach me new technologies it taught me how to make better decisions.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <blockquote>
                        This project didn't make me a financial expert, but it did make me a more thoughtful backend
                        engineer.
                    </blockquote>

                    <h3>Key Lessons</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Plan before coding</strong> - Architecture decisions made early save time later</li>
                        <li><strong>Understand the philosophy</strong> - Frameworks make sense when you understand their
                            principles</li>
                        <li><strong>Don't force technologies</strong> - Flexible design allows better solutions</li>
                        <li><strong>Think like a user</strong> - User perspective drives better design decisions</li>
                        <li><strong>Embrace the lifecycle</strong> - Development includes deployment, monitoring, and
                            maintenance</li>
                        <li><strong>Learn by doing</strong> - Real projects teach more than tutorials</li>
                    </ul>
