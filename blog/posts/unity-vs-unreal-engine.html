                    <p>
                        These two engines are two important players in the world gaming industry. Although there are
                        other alternatives, they make their presence felt in the gaming sector. Naturally, people can
                        be undecided about which engine is better for them. Since it is impossible to categorize this
                        under a single heading, it would be much better to classify it under a few headings.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What is Unity?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Unity was released as open source by Unity Technologies on June 8, 2006, at Apple WWDC 2006.
                        Today, you can access it seamlessly on many different platforms such as Android, iOS, PC,
                        Sony Playstation, and Xbox. Unity can be a good alternative for independent developers and
                        low-budget game studios.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Before Unity, people and game studios had to write their own game engines. This led to both
                        time and money loss. Although Unity is closed source, the free version is valid as long as
                        your income does not exceed $100,000. After that, you are subject to billing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Unity, which initially started with C# and JavaScript, now continues its journey solely with
                        C#. Because C# is an easy-to-learn and powerful language, it provides various advantages.
                    </p>

                            <li><strong>Visual quality</strong> - Default graphics don't match Unreal's out-of-the-box
                                quality</li>

                    <h2>What is Unreal Engine?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Unreal Engine is a game engine that was released in 1998 and has been strengthened with many
                        updates to this day. It is an engine written in C++, UnrealScript, and Assembly. This game
                        engine, which has a very enjoyable development process, allows you to program your games with
                        C++ and Blueprints.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Blueprints work with ready-made C++ code using a drag-and-drop method, making it accessible
                        for artists and designers. Although Unreal Engine is a game engine, it is also a preferred
                        program in the film industry. Furthermore, you can easily work with your audio files with
                        Unreal Audio Engine.
                    </p>

                    <h2>So Which One Would I Choose?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Honestly, I used Unity out of necessity because I entered the gaming industry with a modest
                        computer, and I still use it. However, I never regret it because Unity satisfies me quite a
                        bit with its wide range of job opportunities and developer kits.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Most importantly, I also appreciate that more than 50% of the world's game market value
                        revolves around the mobile sector. When I encounter any problems, I can easily solve them on
                        local and international forum sites, if not 100%, then 90%. As a person, I like simplicity,
                        so I really like Unity's interface.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

                    <p>
                        As you can see, when we talk about Unity vs Unreal Engine, both sides have quite a few
                        strengths and weaknesses. My advice is to <strong>list the needs of your project and compare
                            them</strong>. Continue with whichever engine better meets your needs.
                    </p>

                        <h4><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Key Takeaway</h4>
                        <p>
                            Remember that no game engine is 100% perfect or necessarily meets all your needs. Choose
                            based on your project requirements, team skills, target platform, and budget. Both engines
                            are capable of creating amazing games—it's all about finding the right tool for your
                            specific vision.
