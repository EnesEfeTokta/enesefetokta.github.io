                    <p>
                        Since artificial intelligence entered our lives, it has been advancing with a powerful, fast,
                        and assertive narrative. However, a large part of this narrative is shaped by AI companies'
                        motivation to increase market share and keep economic hype alive.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Terms like "more powerful," "faster," and "smarter" have become the common language of nearly
                        all product narratives. At this point, we need to pause and ask this question:
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        Are AI companies really as objective and trustworthy as we think?
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        In this article, I examine why AI companies' views should not be our primary focus—yet why
                        they remain an important milestone. I also discuss how we can evaluate artificial intelligence
                        from a more balanced perspective.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Economic Reality of AI Companies</h2>

                    <p>
                        Like all other sectors, the ultimate goal of AI companies is to generate revenue. This is
                        neither inherently wrong nor unethical; on the contrary, it's a natural consequence of market
                        reality. However, this reality raises the question of how objective the views presented to the
                        public can be.
                    </p>

                    <div class="critical-box">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> The Hype Machine</h4>
                        <p>
                            When companies have billions of dollars in valuations at stake, their public statements
                            inevitably carry bias. The line between genuine innovation and marketing-driven hype
                            becomes increasingly blurred.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        From my perspective, when discussing artificial intelligence, we should give weight to actors
                        who are on the scientific and application side of the work. I categorize these actors into
                        three main groups.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Three Pillars of Trustworthy AI Discourse</h2>

                    <!-- Group 1 -->
                    <div class="group-card">
                        <h3>
                            <span class="group-number">1</span>
                            Researchers
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Professional and independent researchers are the core actors who determine the direction AI
                            will evolve in the future. They base their work on scientific metrics, experiments, and
                            verifiable results. In this way, they draw the boundaries of real progress in the AI field.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course, not all research today is completely unbiased. For this reason, I believe we
                            should focus on the work of researchers with high academic reputation, especially those
                            working within reputable universities and trustworthy research institutions.
                        </p>

                            <h4><i class="fas fa-flask"></i> Why Researchers Matter</h4>
                            <p>
                                Researchers are bound by peer review, replicability, and scientific integrity. Their
                                careers depend on accuracy, not hype. When a researcher publishes findings, they stake
                                their reputation on the validity of those results.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Group 2 -->
                    <div class="group-card">
                        <h3>
                            <span class="group-number">2</span>
                            Academics and Scientists
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Academics and scientists are the actual chefs in the kitchen where research outputs are
                            processed. New techniques, methods, and theoretical foundations are developed by this group.
                            Mathematical models, algorithms, and architectural structures gain their true capabilities
                            at this stage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In short, if we want to understand "why AI works" or "why it doesn't work," we must look
                            at the academic framework.
                        </p>
                        <div class="highlight-box">

                                While companies may claim breakthrough capabilities, academics provide the theoretical
                                grounding and mathematical proofs. They explain limitations, edge cases, and fundamental
                                constraints that marketing materials conveniently omit.
                            </p>

                        <p>
                            This group—consisting of software developers, doctors, teachers, and other
                            practitioners—directly
                            experiences artificial intelligence and tests its real-world implications. The concrete
                            impact
                            of the theoretical and technical work put forward by the first two groups emerges here.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Has a new algorithm been developed? The real question is this:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote style="font-size: 1rem;">

                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            If the general consensus is "it didn't really help me," that structure, however
                            theoretically
                            strong, won't find practical application. However, if it's widely adopted and creating
                            value,
                            then we can truly talk about a successful and reliable solution.
                        </p>

                            <p>
                                Practitioners provide the ultimate validation. They tell us whether AI actually delivers
                                on its promises in messy, real-world conditions—not in controlled lab environments or
                                cherry-picked demos.

                    <h2>Where Do AI Companies Fit?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Looking at this three-part framework, I think AI companies should not be our primary focus.
                        However, this doesn't mean AI companies should be completely ignored.
                    </p>

                    <div class="thought-box">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> What AI Companies Tell Us</h4>
                        <p>
                            AI companies show us valuable information about the business side of AI:
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Is the product scalable?</strong> Can it handle millions of users, or does it only
                            work in demos?</li>
                        <li><strong>Does it find a market response?</strong> Are real customers paying for it?</li>
                        <li><strong>Is it economically sustainable?</strong> Can the technology support a viable
                            business model?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        The answers to these questions are valuable for understanding the real-world business
                        implications
                        of AI. They tell us what's commercially viable, even if they don't tell us what's scientifically
                        accurate or ethically sound.
                    </p>

                    <div class="critical-box">

                        <p>
                            AI companies are neither villains to be dismissed nor prophets to be blindly followed.
                            They're
                            one voice in a multi-voiced conversation. The key is to weight their contributions
                            appropriately—neither
                            ignoring them nor treating their marketing as gospel truth.

                    <h2>Navigating the AI Hype Cycle</h2>

                    <p>
                        In practice, this means developing a more nuanced approach to AI information:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>When an AI company makes a claim</strong>, ask: "Has this been peer-reviewed? What
                            do independent researchers say?"</li>
                        <li><strong>When reading about breakthroughs</strong>, look for academic papers, not just press
                            releases</li>
                        <li><strong>When evaluating a tool</strong>, prioritize practitioner reviews and real-world case
                            studies over vendor testimonials</li>
                        <li><strong>When assessing AI's impact</strong>, consider multiple perspectives: technical
                            limitations, ethical implications, and practical applications</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="thought-box">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> A Framework for Critical Thinking</h4>
                        <p>
                            Ask yourself: Who benefits from this narrative? What evidence supports it? What
                            counter-evidence
                            exists? Who has been left out of this conversation?
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Conclusion: A Multi-Voiced Perspective</h2>

                    <p>
                        From my viewpoint, we should learn about the future of artificial intelligence not solely from
                        AI companies' rhetoric, but from the collective wisdom of independent researchers, academics,
                        and practitioner communities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We should evaluate the steps taken by AI companies within this framework and form our own
                        synthesis.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        Ultimately, artificial intelligence is one of humanity's most impressive technological
                        achievements.
                        For this reason, to truly understand it, we don't need hype—we need a multi-voiced and conscious
                        perspective.
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        The AI revolution is real, but it's not happening in the way marketing teams would have you
                        believe. It's happening in research labs, academic journals, and on the laptops of practitioners
                        who are quietly solving real problems.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>That's where we should be listening.</strong>
                    </p>
